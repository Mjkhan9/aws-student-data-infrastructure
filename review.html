        <h1>Faculty Review & Project Outcomes</h1>
        <p>
            This infrastructure project underwent formal evaluation by a three-member faculty review panel consisting 
            of experts in cloud architecture, information security, and educational technology systems. The review 
            assessed technical design quality, security posture, operational readiness, documentation completeness, 
            and alignment with real-world enterprise practices. The evaluation process included architecture review, 
            security audit simulation, automation testing, and presentation to the panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            The panel evaluated the project against production infrastructure standards used by educational institutions, 
            healthcare organizations, and financial services companies managing sensitive personal information. All 
            components were assessed for FERPA compliance, AWS Well-Architected Framework alignment, and operational 
            excellence principles.

            <h3>Architecture and Design (Lead Reviewer)</h3>
            <p class="feedback-quote">
                "The three-tier VPC architecture demonstrates strong understanding of network segmentation principles. 
                The use of security group referencing rather than IP-based rules shows awareness of operational best 
                practices. The multi-AZ deployment with NAT Gateway redundancy ensures production-grade availability. 
                This design closely mirrors patterns we see in real student information systems at major universities."
            </p>
            <p class="feedback-quote">
                "Particularly impressive is the complete isolation of the database tier with no internet gateway routing. 
                The VPC endpoints for S3 and Systems Manager eliminate unnecessary internet traversal while maintaining 
                operational access. The subnet sizing and CIDR allocation demonstrate thoughtful capacity planning."
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback-section">
            <h3>Security and Compliance (Security Reviewer)</h3>
            <p class="feedback-quote">
                "The defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers (security groups, NACLs, IAM policies, 
                encryption) provides robust protection. Customer-managed KMS keys with automatic rotation align with 
                enterprise key management best practices. The CloudTrail configuration with log file integrity validation 
                ensures tamper-proof audit trails suitable for compliance audits."
            </p>
            <p class="feedback-quote">
                "IAM automation enforces least-privilege consistently, eliminating human error in permission assignment. 
                The tag-based S3 access control demonstrates advanced understanding of attribute-based access. FERPA 
                compliance mappings are thorough and well-documented. The inclusion of GuardDuty for threat detection 
                shows awareness of modern security operations practices."
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback-section">
            <h3>Automation and Operations (Operations Reviewer)</h3>
            <p class="feedback-quote">
                "The IAM provisioning automation achieves measurable efficiency gains while maintaining reliability. 
                The 67% time reduction is significant and the zero-error rate demonstrates robust validation logic. 
                The script's idempotent design and demo mode functionality show production-ready engineering practices."
            </p>
            <p class="feedback-quote">
                "Documentation quality would enable rapid knowledge transfer to operations teams. The inclusion of 
                runbooks, monitoring configurations, and troubleshooting guides demonstrates operational maturity. 
                The comprehensive logging strategy spanning CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and application logs provides 
                visibility needed for production support."
