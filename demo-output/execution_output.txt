AWS IAM PROVISIONING AUTOMATION
Student Data Infrastructure Project
Execution Date: March 10, 2024
======================================================================

[DEMO MODE] Running without AWS credentials - safe simulation

[STEP 1] Validating IAM group structure...
  [DEMO] Group 'StudentDataRestrictedAccess' verified
  [DEMO] Group 'StudentDataAnalysts' verified
  [DEMO] Group 'StudentDataAdministrators' verified

[STEP 2] Attaching managed policies to groups...
  [DEMO] Policy 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess'
         attached to 'StudentDataRestrictedAccess'

[STEP 3] Deploying custom bucket access policy...
  [DEMO] Custom policy 'StudentDataBucketAccess' created with tag-based access control
  [DEMO] Policy restricts access to: s3://student-data-reports-production
  [DEMO] Access control enforced via object tags:
         DataClassification=StudentRecords

[STEP 4] Provisioning 5 user identities...

  → Provisioning: registrar_office_analyst
    [DEMO] Created user with tags: Role=analyst, Department=Registrar
    [DEMO] Tagged with: DataAccess=StudentRecords, MFARequired=true
    [DEMO] Added to group 'StudentDataRestrictedAccess'
    [✓] User provisioned successfully

  → Provisioning: student_data_specialist
    [DEMO] Created user with tags: Role=specialist, Department=IT
    [DEMO] Tagged with: DataAccess=StudentRecords, MFARequired=true
    [DEMO] Added to group 'StudentDataRestrictedAccess'
    [✓] User provisioned successfully

  → Provisioning: enrollment_reporting_svc
    [DEMO] Created user with tags: Role=service_account, Department=Enrollment
    [DEMO] Tagged with: DataAccess=StudentRecords, MFARequired=true
    [DEMO] Added to group 'StudentDataRestrictedAccess'
    [✓] User provisioned successfully

  → Provisioning: compliance_auditor
    [DEMO] Created user with tags: Role=auditor, Department=Compliance
    [DEMO] Tagged with: DataAccess=StudentRecords, MFARequired=true
    [DEMO] Added to group 'StudentDataAdministrators'
    [✓] User provisioned successfully

  → Provisioning: institutional_research
    [DEMO] Created user with tags: Role=researcher, Department=Research
    [DEMO] Tagged with: DataAccess=StudentRecords, MFARequired=true
    [DEMO] Added to group 'StudentDataRestrictedAccess'
    [✓] User provisioned successfully

[✓] Provisioned 5/5 identities in 0.52 seconds
